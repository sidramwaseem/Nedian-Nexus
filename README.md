# Nedian-Nexus - Ecommerce Website

## Overview of the Project

It is often noticed how Freshies being new in a university face shyness issues when it comes to approaching seniors,be it for course materials or any activity. keeping in mind this problem, the given site is designed for university students where they can buy course materials, notebooks and many more. But, it is restricted only for the students belonging to NED University, since you need CloudID provided by university to register. However, being a NED student there is no restriction, you can be a buyer and seller both. I mean it never hurts to earn a little cash along with studies.
